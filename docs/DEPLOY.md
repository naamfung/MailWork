Deploying MailWork
=================

### Command line

You can run MailWork locally from the command line.

    go get MailWork
    MailWork -h

To configure MailWork, use the environment variables or command line flags
described in the [CONFIG](CONFIG.md).

### Using supervisord/upstart/etc

MailWork can be started as a daemon using supervisord/upstart/etc.

See [this example init script](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mailwork/blob/master/templates/mailwork.init.j2)
and [this Ansible role](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-mailwork) by [geerlingguy](https://github.com/geerlingguy).

If installed with Homebrew on OSX you can have launchd start mailwork now and restart at login:
    brew services start mailwork

### Docker

The example [Dockerfile](../Dockerfile) can be used to run MailWork in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.

You can run it directly from Docker Hub (thanks [humboldtux](https://github.com/humboldtux))

    docker run -d -p 1025:1025 -p 143:143 -p 8025:8025 mailwork/mailwork

To mount the Maildir to the local filesystem, you can use a volume:

    docker run -d -e "MH_STORAGE=maildir" -v $PWD/maildir:/maildir -p 1025:1025 -p 143:143 -p 8025:8025 mailwork/mailwork

### Elastic Beanstalk

You can deploy MailWork using [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/).

1. Open the Elastic Beanstalk console
2. Create a zip file containing the Dockerfile and MailWork binary
3. Create a new Elastic Beanstalk application
4. Launch a new environment and upload the zip file

**Note** You'll need to reconfigure nginx in Elastic Beanstalk to expose both
ports as TCP, since by default it proxies the first exposed port to port 80 as HTTP.

If you're using in-memory storage, you can only use a single instance of
MailWork. To use a load balanced EB application, use MongoDB backed storage.

To configure your Elastic Beanstalk MailWork instance, either:

* Set environment variables using the Elastic Beanstalk console
* Edit the Dockerfile to pass in command line arguments

You may face restrictions on outbound SMTP from EC2, for example if you are
releasing messages to real SMTP servers.

### SaltStack

For deploying MailWork using [SaltStack](https://github.com/saltstack/salt), there's a
[SaltStack Formula](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/development/conventions/formulas.html)
available in [github.com/ssc-services/salt-formulas-public](https://github.com/ssc-services/salt-formulas-public/tree/master/mailwork).
